As we know, unikernels are specialised single address space machine images
that are constructed by using library operating systems.  MirageOS is one such
libOS, where we've taken a clean-slate approach to building systems with a
focus on safety.

There are clearly benefits and trade-offs to this approach so it's no surprise
that a number of other implementations have also emerged over the years, which
make different trade-offs.  These range from handling legacy applications,
making the most of existing OS codebases, to running on different environments.
All of these implementations ultimately help developers construct unikernels
that match their specific needs and constraints.

As word about unikernels in general is spreading, more people are trying to
learn about this new approach to programming the cloud and embedded devices.
Since information is spread across multiple sites, it can be tricky to know
where to get an overview and how to get started quickly. So to help people get
on board, there's a new community website [unikernel.org][]!

The [unikernel.org][] community site aims to collate information about the
various projects and provide a focal point for early adopters to understand
more about the technology and become involved in the projects themselves. Over
time, we hope it will become a gathering place to share stories and advances
that the community is making and ease the process of bringing in new
contributors and users for the range of projects.

Please do visit the site and consider contributing stories about how you're
using unikernels!
