[Xenstore](http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/XenStore) is a critical service found on all hosts
running [Xen](http://www.xen.org/). Xenstore is necessary to
  * configure all VM I/O devices such as disk controllers and network interface cards;
  * share performance statistics and OS version information; and
  * signal VMs during shutdown, suspend, resume, migrate etc.

Xenstore must be **reliable**: if it fails then the host is unmanageable and must be rebooted.
Xenstore must be **secure**: if it is compromised by a VM then that VM can access data belonging
to other VMs.

The current version of Xenstore is [already written in OCaml](http://xenbits.xen.org/gitweb/?p=xen.git;a=tree;f=tools/ocaml/xenstored;h=0d762f2a61de098c0100814e0c140575b51688a3;hb=stable-4.4)
and documented in the paper
[OXenstored: an efficient hierarchical and transactional database using functional programming with reference cell comparisons](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~apt/icfp09_accepted_papers/83.html) presented at ICFP2009.
The existing code works really well but
there is always room for improvement; and this is where Irmin, 
the storage layer of Mirage 2.0, can
help.

The design goals of the Irmin-based Mirage Xenstore server are:
  1. safely restart after a crash-- currently if xenstored stops for any reason then the host must be rebooted;
  2. make system debugging easy; and
  3. go really fast!

How does Irmin help achieve these goals?

Restarting after crashes
------------------------

The Xenstore service is a reliable component and very rarely crashes. However the
impact of a crash is quite severe: there is no protocol for a running VM to close
its connection to a Xenstore and open a new one, so if Xenstore crashes then running
VMs are simply left orphaned. VMs in this state are impossible to manage properly:
there is no way to shutdown cleanly, to suspend/resume or migrate, or to configure
any disk or network interfaces. Typically when Xenstore crashes the host is rebooted
shortly after.

Irmin can help make Xenstore recoverable after a crash. Irmin
is a library which applications can use to persist and synchronise
distributed data structures on disk and in memory. If we use Irmin to persist all our state 
somewhere sensible and take care to manage our I/O carefully then the server process
becomes stateless and can be restarted at will.

To make Xenstore use Irmin,
the first task is to enumerate all the different kinds of state in the running process.
This includes the obvious key-value pairs used for VM configuration
as well as data currently hidden away in the OCaml heap:
the addresses in memory of established communication rings,
per-domain quotas, pending watch events and watch registrations etc etc. 
Once the state has been enumerated it must be mapped onto key-value pairs which can
be stored in Irmin. Rather than using ad-hoc mappings everywhere, the Mirage Irmin
server has
[persistent Maps](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-xenstore-server/blob/blog/introducing-irmin-in-xenstore/server/pMap.mli),
[persistent Sets](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-xenstore-server/blob/blog/introducing-irmin-in-xenstore/server/pSet.ml),
[persistent Queues](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-xenstore-server/blob/blog/introducing-irmin-in-xenstore/server/pQueue.ml)
and
[persistent reference cells](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-xenstore-server/blob/blog/introducing-irmin-in-xenstore/server/pRef.ml).

Irmin applications are naturally written as functors, with the details of the persistence kept
abstract.
The following [Irmin-inspired](https://github.com/mirage/irmin/blob/0.8.3/lib/core/irminView.mli) signature represents what Xenstore needs
from Irmin:
```
module type VIEW = sig
  type t

  val create: unit -> t Lwt.t
  (** Create a fresh VIEW from the current state of the store.
      A VIEW tracks state queries and updates and acts like a branch
      which has an explicit [merge]. *)

  val read: t -> Protocol.Path.t -> [ `Ok of Node.contents | `Enoent of Protocol.Path.t ] Lwt.t
  (** Read a single key *)

  val list: t -> Protocol.Path.t -> [ `Ok of string list | `Enoent of Protocol.Path.t ] Lwt.t
  (** List all the children of a key *)

  val write: t -> Protocol.Path.t -> Node.contents -> [ `Ok of unit ] Lwt.t
  (** Update a single key *)

  val mem: t -> Protocol.Path.t -> bool Lwt.t
  (** Check whether a key exists *)

  val rm: t -> Protocol.Path.t -> [ `Ok of unit ] Lwt.t
  (** Remove a key *)

  val merge: t -> string -> bool Lwt.t
  (** Merge this VIEW into the current state of the store *)
end
```
The main 'business logic' of Xenstore can then be functorised over this signature relatively easily.
All we need is to write the top-levels: one for Mirage userspace and one for kernelspace
which use the Irmin libraries to implement this signature and persist the data somewhere sensible.

In the userspace top-level we use Irmin to persist the data in a
[git](http://git-scm.com) format repository in the filesystem as follows:
```
    let open Irmin_unix in
    let module Git = IrminGit.FS(struct
      let root = Some filename
      let bare = true
    end) in
    let module DB = Git.Make(IrminKey.SHA1)(IrminContents.String)(IrminTag.String) in
    DB.create () >>= fun db ->
```
and then our `VIEW.t` is simply an Irmin `DB.View.t`. All that remains is to implement
`read`, `list`, `write`, `rm` by
  1. mapping Xenstore `Protocol.Path.t` values onto Irmin keys; and
  2. mapping Xenstore `Node.contents` records onto Irmin values.

As it happens Xenstore and Irmin have similar notions of "paths" so the first mapping is
easy. We currently use [sexplib](https://github.com/janestreet/sexplib) to map Node.contents
values onto strings for Irmin.

The resulting [Irmin glue module](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-xenstore-server/blob/blog/introducing-irmin-in-xenstore/userspace/main.ml#L101) looks like:
```
    let module V = struct
      type t = DB.View.t
      let create = DB.View.create
      let write t path contents =
        DB.View.update t (value_of_filename path) (Sexp.to_string (Node.sexp_of_contents contents))
      (* omit read,list,write,rm for brevity *)
      let merge t origin =
        let origin = IrminOrigin.create "%s" origin in
        DB.View.merge_path ~origin db [] t >>= function
        | `Ok () -> return true
        | `Conflict msg ->
          info "Conflict while merging database view: %s" msg;
          return false
    end in
```

Now all that remains is to carefully adjust the I/O code so that effects (reading and writing packets
along the persistent connections) are interleaved properly with persisted state changes and
voil√†, we now have a xenstore which can recover after a restart.

Easy system debugging
---------------------

When something goes wrong on a Xen system it's standard procedure to
  1. take a snapshot of the current state of Xenstore; and
  2. examine the log files for signs of trouble.

Unfortunately by the
time this is done, interesting Xenstore state has usually been deleted. Unfortunately the first task
of the human operator is to evaluate by-hand the logged actions in reverse to figure out what the state
actually was when the problem happened. Obviously this is tedious, error-prone and not always
possible since the log statements are ad-hoc and don't always include the data you need to know.

In the new Irmin-powered Xenstore the history is preserved in a git-format repository, and can
be explored using your favourite git viewing tool. Each store
update has a compact one-line summary, a more verbose multi-line explanation and (of course)
the full state change is available on demand.

For example you can view the history in a highly-summarised form with:
```
$ git log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --graph
* 2578013 Closing connection -1 to domain 0
* d4728ba Domain 0: rm /bench/local/domain/0/backend/vbd/10 = ()
* 4b55c99 Domain 0: directory /bench/local/domain/0/backend = [ vbd ]
* a71a903 Domain 0: rm /bench/local/domain/10 = ()
* f267b31 Domain 0: rm /bench/vss/uuid-10 = ()
* 94df8ce Domain 0: rm /bench/vm/uuid-10 = ()
* 0abe6b0 Domain 0: directory /bench/vm/uuid-10/domains = [  ]
* 06ddd3b Domain 0: rm /bench/vm/uuid-10/domains/10 = ()
* 1be2633 Domain 0: read /bench/local/domain/10/vss = /bench/vss/uuid-10
* 237a8e4 Domain 0: read /bench/local/domain/10/vm = /bench/vm/uuid-10
* 49d70f6 Domain 0: directory /bench/local/domain/10/device = [  ]
*   ebf4935 Merge view to /
|\
| * e9afd9f Domain 0: read /bench/local/domain/10 =
* | c4e0fa6 Domain 0: merging transaction 375
|/
```
You can then 'zoom in' and show the exact state change with commands like:
```
 git show bd44e03
commit bd44e0388696380cafd048eac49474f68d41bd3a

```
Last but not least, you can `git checkout` to the exact time the problem occurred and examine
the state of the store.


Going really fast
-----------------

Xenstore is part of the control-plane of a Xen system and is most heavily stressed when lots
of VMs are being started in parallel. Each VM start operation consists of a set of transactions,
one per virtual device. When starting lots of VMs in parallel, we must be able to merge lots
of transactions in parallel. Earlier versions of Xenstore had naieve transaction merging algorithms
which aborted many of these transactions, causing the clients to re-issue them. This led to a live-lock
where clients were constantly re-issuing the same transactions again and again. Happily Irmin's
default merging strategy performs much better by default, and Irmin xenstore is always able to
make forward progress. Furthermore, since Irmin's merging strategy is configurable by the application,
we can be assured that we can customise it to meet our future needs.
