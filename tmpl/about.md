!!The Team

Mirage is hacked on by a few people:

* [Anil Madhavapeddy](http://anil.recoil.org/): most things, mainly the Xen/UNIX backends and network subsystem
* [Thomas Gazagnaire](http://gazagnaire.org/): most things, mainly the Javascript backend and web libraries
* [Richard Mortier](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~rmm/): performance maestro

And valued friends contributing code and ideas as they find time:

* [Raphael Proust](https://github.com/raphael-proust): intern joining us in Cambridge this summer for some hackery
* [Julian Chesterfield](http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/julian-chesterfield/1/495/3b7): Citrix Xen storage guru
* [Mike McClurg](https://twitter.com/#!/mcclurmc): Citrix management stack hacker

!!The Project

We are grateful to funding by the RCUK Horizon Digital Economy Research Hub grant, EP/G065802/1.
Amazon also gave us an [Amazon in Education](http://aws.amazon.com/education/) award to test on EC2, and Verisign is [sponsoring](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/news/2011/03/anil-madhavapeddy-wins-verisign-grant/) work on the secure DNS library.
