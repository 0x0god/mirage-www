## The Community

All Mirage development is done via [GitHub](https://github.com), consisting of
a set of [libraries](https://github.com/mirage) that form the core
distribution.  It is all glued together via the [OPAM](http://opam.ocaml.org)
package manager.  All of the libraries are either under the [LGPLv2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html)
or the liberal [ISC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license) license.

If you find bugs or installation issues, please report them via the main
[Mirage issue tracker](https://github.com/mirage/mirage/issue).  Broader
queries or OCaml questions are very welcome on our [mailing list](http://lists.xenproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/mirageos-devel).
