### Background

MirageOS is a library operating system using cooperative multitasking, which can
be executed as a guest of the Xen hypervisor. Output on the console is performed
via the Xen console protocol.

### Problem Description

Since MirageOS moved from PV mode to PVH, and thus replacing Mini-OS with solo5,
there was an issue in the solo5 code which failed to properly account the
already written bytes on the console. This only occurs if the output to be
performed does not fit in a single output buffer (2048 bytes on Xen).

The code in question set the number of bytes written to the last written count
(written = output_some(buf)), instead of increasing the written count
(written += output_some(buf)).

### Impact

Console output may lead to an infinite loop, endlessly printing data onto the
console.

A prominent unikernel is the Qubes MirageOS firewall, which prints some input
packets onto the console. This can lead to a remote denial of service
vulnerability, since any client could send a malformed and sufficiently big
network packet.

### Workaround

No workaround is available.

### Solution

The solution is to fix the console output code in solo5, as done in
https://github.com/Solo5/solo5/pull/538/commits/099be86f0a17a619fcadbb970bb9e511d28d3cd8

The recommended way to upgrade is:
```bash
opam update
opam upgrade solo5
```

### Correction details

The following PRs were part of the fix:

- - [solo5/pull/538](https://github.com/Solo5/solo5/pull/538) - xen console: update the "to be written" count
- - [qubes-mirage-firewall/pull/167](https://github.com/mirage/qubes-mirage-firewall/pull/167) - update opam repository commit
