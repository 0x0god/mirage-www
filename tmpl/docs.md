!! Documentation

Mirage is still under heavy development, and so there is no detailed documentation available.  However, if you are keen to hack, you can read the [INSTALL](http://github.com/avsm/mirage/blob/master/INSTALL) file and give it a shot.

Feedback and questions are always welcome via e-mail to <tt>mirage at recoil.org</tt> or occasionally catch us on <tt>#mirage</tt> on FreeNode IRC.

The best way to wait for a release is to <a href="http://github.com/avsm/mirage/toggle_watch">watch</a> the project on [GitHub](http://github.com/avsm/mirage).
