15th April 2014

Agenda
======

Attendees: Amir Chaudhry, Jonathan Ludlam, Anil Madhavapeddy, David Scott,
 Thomas Leonard, Thomas Gazagnaire

GSoC
----

We have 2: (a) and (b). For (a): shall we do IPv6 or fuzz testing? Thomas points out that IPv6 is good marketing. JonL described his [xen-testvm](https://github.com/jonludlam/xen-testvm) which can be used to emit packets, read and write block etc. (b) will probably work on the cloud API bindings (mainly mentored by Dave)

Conduit
-------

A nice API to open SSL connections. In future it will support other types of connections and clean-slate SSL stacks. It was quite a big rewrite. We should use it everywhere were we want to open connections (e.g. SSL clients).

vchan
-----

Currently only used by xen-testvm, which isn't currently building because it's pre-Mirage 1.0. JonL has agreed to add vchan support to Anil's conduit library.

Irminsule
---------

Thomas reports that merging is working (more or less). He's started to work on a dispatcher, where you can assemble together different backends (memory, disk, ...). You will be able to decide which backend to use based on the key, provided first class modules are up to the task.

ARM
---

ThomasL has been getting Anil's stuff to work on the Cubieboard. Hit a bug in xen causing the hypervisor to crash. Now that's fixed, the miniOS VM is running and printing stuff on the screen; it could be replaced with Mirage. ThomasL has started looking at FreeBSD.

Anil suggests hooking up the console ring to MiniOS to log on the regular console rather the debug console. Anil suggested that it might be a good time to re-integrate the OCaml runtime with miniOS, since the current integration is a little bit hacky. Perhaps after FreeBSD it would be good to figure out the easiest strategy.

Tutorial day
------------

Amir says: we need to discuss a date. Anil: we don't have a location!
Anil says: why not just say Jun 11?

Using codio
-----------

Amir will try that for next time.
