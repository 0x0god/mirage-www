!!!ICFP

This was a report delivered at ICFP 2010 about our experiences with using OCaml in the Xen management toolstack. 
Not directly Mirage-related, but much of the inspiration for trying out OCaml in a microkernel environment came out of this work.

!!Slides

This is an archive of some of the talks we've given. If you want to browse, just pick the latest one, but it's occasionally interesting to see the evolution of the projects through how it is presented, so all of them are present here.
