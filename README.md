# Mirage Website

This repository contains the Mirage public website, <http://openmirage.org/>.

It provides information about the project as well as the blog and wiki.

It also serves as a good first self-hosting test case.

To update, send a pull request. When successfully merged, the Travis CI scripts,
fetched from <https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-travisci-skeleton/>, will cause the
generated Xen unikernel to be committed back to the
<https://github.com/mirage/mirage-decks-deployment> repo.
